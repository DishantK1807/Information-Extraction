He is the founder, CEO, and CTO of SpaceX; co-founder, CEO, and product architect of Tesla Motors; co-founder and chairman of SolarCity; co-chairman of OpenAI; co-founder of Zip2; and founder of X.com which merged with PayPal of Confinity.[18][19][20][21] As of June 2016, he has an estimated net worth of US$12.7 billion, making him the 83rd wealthiest person in the world.[22]

Musk has stated that the goals of SolarCity, Tesla Motors, and SpaceX revolve around his vision to change the world and humanity.[23] His goals include reducing global warming through sustainable energy production and consumption, and reducing the "risk of human extinction" by "making life multiplanetary"[24][25] by setting up a human colony on Mars.

In addition to his primary business pursuits, he has also envisioned a high-speed transportation system known as the Hyperloop, and has proposed a VTOL supersonic jet aircraft with electric fan propulsion, known as the Musk electric jet.[26][27]
Musk was born June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, Transvaal, South Africa,[28] the son of Maye (née Haldeman), a model and dietician from Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada;[29] and Errol Musk, a South African-born electromechanical engineer. He has a younger brother, Kimbal (born 1972), and a younger sister, Tosca (born 1974).[29][30][31][32] His paternal grandmother was British, and he also has Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.[33][34] After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk lived mostly with his father in locations in South Africa.[33]

At age 10, he developed an interest in computing with the Commodore VIC-20.[35] He taught himself computer programming and at age 12, sold the code for a BASIC-based video game he created called Blastar to a magazine called PC and Office Technology for approximately US$500.[36][37] A web version of the game is available online.[36][38]

Musk was severely bullied throughout his childhood, and was once hospitalized when a group of boys threw him down a flight of stairs and then beat him until he blacked out.[39]

Musk was initially educated at private schools, attending the English-speaking Waterkloof House Preparatory School. Musk later graduated from Pretoria Boys High School and moved to Canada in June 1989, just before his 18th birthday,[40] after obtaining Canadian citizenship through his Canadian-born mother.[41][42]
